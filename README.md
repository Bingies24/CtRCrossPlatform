# Cut the Rope Cross Platform Decompilation

This is a better version of the Cut the Rope Decompilation which can be found on [Cut the Rope Home](https://ctrhome.github.io) (specifically the original unpatched version on the Discord server) that has been freed from the clutches of WinForms for future modding.



### Compiles on:

* Windows — Windows and Linux, via Visual Studio or build\_windows.bat.
* Linux — Windows (probably works) and Linux, via build\_linux.sh.



## To-do

* Implement a video player, preferably something that is light on size (so no ffmpeg), CPU and GPU load.
* Redo game and window scaling.
* Add fullscreen back.
* Add touchscreen support.
* Make an Android version.



## Notes

To keep OpenAL happy, make sure your sound effects are stereo.
