# Cut the Rope ~~Peak Edition~~ Cross Platform Decompilation

This is a version of the Cut the Rope Decompilation which can be found on [Cut the Rope Home](https://ctrhome.github.io) (specifically the original unpatched version on the Discord server) that has been freed from the clutches of WinForms for future modding.



### Compiles on:

* Windows — Windows and Linux, via Visual Studio or build\_windows.bat.
* Linux — Linux, via build\_linux.sh. Windows probably builds too but I haven't tested that.



## To-do

Implement a video player, preferably something that is light on size, CPU and GPU load, and not something tha uses ffmpeg.
